                    continuously improve in my work. Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean
                    start-ups and was a member of the first New Zealand start-up to attend Y
                    Combinator, the largest start-up accelerator in the world. From there, I worked my
                    way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the design of 30+
                    mobile and desktop apps. Currently, I lead UI/UX design at Saas start-up
                    VideoMyJob. With a deep understanding of user experience design and a
                    commitment to developing as both a designer and a person, I am excited to see
                    what is next in store for me.

                    At VideoMyJob I have enjoyed working on a successful product where I am able to
                    see the impact of my designs more closely. In this role, I have had the opportunity to
                    do more user research, prototyping and testing which I've used to influence final
                    designs.
